# Rover
 
The rover must use a laser sensor for distance measurement, an odometer attached to its servo motor and a camera as sensoring devices, all of them connected to an arduino microcontroller. 
An odroid containing the ROS package is in turn receiving the information from the microcontroller for its processing. 
The task consists of detectintg, identifying and collecting multiple AR tags, spread across a maze with obstacles.
